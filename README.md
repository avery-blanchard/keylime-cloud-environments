Ansible role to deploy the [Rust-Keylime](https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime) agent with the [Keylime](https://github.com/keylime/keylime) registrar and verifier against a Virtualized TPM.

This role is currently configured to work with a Fedora 35 instance on Google Cloud with the vTPM enabled. 


Contributions are welcome, should anyone wish to have this role provision other Linux distributions.

For details on using Keylime, please consult the
[project documentation](https://keylime-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For details on the Rust agent, please consult the [repository](https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime).

## Usage
Run the playbook against your target remote host(s). Note: the hosts must have the vTPM enabled in the Google Cloud Console. 

```bash
ansible-playbook -i your_hosts playbook.yml
```
## Getting started with Keylime 
The best way to get started is to read the [Keylime
Documentation](https://keylime-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), however if you're keen to get started right away, follow these steps.

To start the Keylime verifier and registrar, you will need to start the following services. 

`# keylime_verifier`

`# keylime_registrar`

To start the Keylime rust agent, navigate to the rust-keylime directory and run the following command.

`# RUST_LOG=keylime_agent=trace cargo run --bin keylime_agent`

You can now set up a use case, a good first scenario to try out would be [IMA
Integrity Monitoring](https://keylime-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/runtime_ima.html)

For more detailed set up scenarios, see the [Keylime
documentation](https://keylime-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/runtime_ima.html)
